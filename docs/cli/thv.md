## thv

ToolHive (thv) is a lightweight, secure, and fast manager for MCP servers

### Synopsis

ToolHive (thv) is a lightweight, secure, and fast manager for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
It is written in Go and has extensive test coverage—including input validation—to ensure reliability and security.

Under the hood, ToolHive acts as a very thin client for the Docker/Podman Unix socket API.
This design choice allows it to remain both efficient and lightweight while still providing powerful,
container-based isolation for running MCP servers.
