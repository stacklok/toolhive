# ToolHive Architecture Overview

## Introduction

ToolHive is a lightweight, secure platform for managing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure that goes beyond simple container orchestration, offering rich middleware capabilities, security features, and flexible deployment options.

## What is ToolHive?

ToolHive is a **platform** - not just a container runner. It provides the building blocks needed to:

- **Securely deploy** MCP servers with network isolation and permission profiles
- **Proxy and enhance** MCP server communications with middleware
- **Aggregate and compose** multiple MCP servers into unified interfaces
- **Manage at scale** using Kubernetes operators or local deployments
- **Curate and distribute** trusted MCP server registries

The platform is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to build on top of its proxy and middleware capabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. Command-Line Interface (thv)

The primary CLI tool for managing MCP servers locally. Located in `cmd/thv/`.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Start, stop, restart, and manage MCP server workloads
- Configure middleware, authentication, and authorization
- Export and import workload configurations
- Manage groups and client configurations

**Usage patterns:**
```bash
# Run from registry
thv run server-name

# Run from container image
thv run ghcr.io/example/mcp-server:latest

# Run using protocol schemes
thv run uvx://package-name
thv run npx://package-name
thv run go://package-name
```

### 2. Kubernetes Operator (thv-operator)

Manages MCP servers in Kubernetes clusters using custom resources.

The operator watches for `MCPServer`, `MCPRegistry`, `MCPToolConfig`, and `MCPExternalAuthConfig` CRDs, reconciling them into Kubernetes resources (Deployments, StatefulSets, Services).

**For details**, see:
- [`cmd/thv-operator/README.md`](../../cmd/thv-operator/README.md) - Operator overview and usage
- [`cmd/thv-operator/DESIGN.md`](../../cmd/thv-operator/DESIGN.md) - Design decisions and patterns
- [`docs/operator/crd-api.md`](../operator/crd-api.md) - Complete CRD API reference
- [Operator Architecture](09-operator-architecture.md) - Architecture documentation

### 3. Proxy Runner (thv-proxyrunner)

A specialized binary used by the Kubernetes operator. Located in `cmd/thv-proxyrunner/`.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Run as proxy container in Kubernetes Deployments
- Dynamically create and manage MCP server StatefulSets via the Kubernetes API
- Handle transport-specific proxying (SSE, streamable-http, stdio)
- Apply middleware chain to incoming requests

**Deployment pattern:**
```
Deployment (proxy-runner) -> StatefulSet (MCP server)
```

### 4. Registry API Server (thv-registry-api)

A registry API server for hosting custom MCP server registries. Located in `cmd/thv-registry-api/`.

> **Note**: The registry API server is being moved out of the main ToolHive repository into its own project.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Serve MCP server registry data
- Support ToolHive's registry format
- Future support for upstream MCP registry format
- Provide file-based and Kubernetes ConfigMap storage

## Core Concepts

For detailed definitions and relationships, see [Core Concepts](02-core-concepts.md).

**Key concepts:**
- **Workloads** - Complete deployment units (container + proxy + config)
- **Transports** - Communication protocols (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)
- **Middleware** - Composable request processing layers
- **RunConfig** - Portable configuration format
- **Permission Profiles** - Security policies
- **Groups** - Logical server collections
- **Registry** - Catalog of trusted MCP servers

## Deployment Modes

### Local Mode

ToolHive can run locally in two ways:

#### 1. CLI Mode

Direct command-line usage via `thv` binary:
- Spawns MCP servers as detached processes
- Uses Docker/Podman/Colima/Rancher Desktop for container runtime
- Stores state using XDG Base Directory Specification (typically `~/.config/toolhive/`, `~/.local/state/toolhive/`)

#### 2. UI Mode

Via [ToolHive Studio](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio):
- Spawns a ToolHive API server (`thv serve`)
- Exposes RESTful API for UI operations
- Uses Docker/Podman/Colima/Rancher Desktop for containers
- Provides web-based management interface

### Kubernetes Mode

Everything is driven by `thv-operator`:
- Listens for Kubernetes custom resources
- Creates Kubernetes-native resources (Deployments, StatefulSets, Services)
- Uses `thv-proxyrunner` binary (not `thv`)
- Provides cluster-scale management

**Deployment pattern:**
```
Deployment (thv-proxyrunner) -> StatefulSet (MCP server container)
```

## How ToolHive Proxies MCP Traffic

### For Stdio Transport

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Middleware
    participant Proxy as Stdio Proxy
    participant Stdin as Container<br/>stdin
    participant Stdout as Container<br/>stdout

    Note over Client,Stdout: Middleware at HTTP Boundary

    rect rgb(230, 240, 255)
        Note over Client,Stdin: Independent Flow: Client → Container
        Client->>Middleware: HTTP Request (SSE or Streamable)
        Middleware->>Proxy: After auth/authz/audit
        Note over Proxy: HTTP → JSON-RPC
        Proxy->>Stdin: Write to stdin
    end

    rect rgb(255, 240, 230)
        Note over Stdout,Client: Independent Flow: Container → Client (async)
        Stdout->>Proxy: Read from stdout
        Note over Proxy: JSON-RPC → HTTP
        Proxy->>Client: SSE (broadcast) or Streamable (correlated)
    end

    Note over Client,Stdout: stdin and stdout are independent streams
```

### For SSE/Streamable HTTP Transports

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Proxy as Transparent Proxy
    participant Container as MCP Server

    Client->>Proxy: HTTP Request
    Proxy->>Proxy: Apply Middleware
    Proxy->>Container: Forward Request
    Container->>Proxy: HTTP Response
    Proxy->>Client: Forward Response
```

## Protocol Builds

ToolHive supports automatic containerization of packages using protocol schemes:

- `uvx://package-name` - Python packages via `uv`
- `npx://package-name` - Node.js packages via `npx`
- `go://package-name` - Go packages
- `go://./local-path` - Local Go projects

These are automatically converted to container images at runtime.

## Five Ways to Run an MCP Server

1. **From Registry**: `thv run server-name`
2. **From Container Image**: `thv run ghcr.io/example/mcp:latest`
3. **Using Protocol Scheme**: `thv run uvx://package-name`
4. **From Exported Config**: `thv run --from-config path/to/config.json` - Useful for sharing configurations, migrating workloads, or version-controlling server setups
5. **Remote MCP Server**: `thv run <URL>`

When contributing to ToolHive's architecture:

1. Ensure changes maintain the platform abstraction
