## thv secret reset-keyring

Reset the keyring password

### Synopsis

Reset the keyring password used to encrypt secrets.

This command resets the master password stored in your OS keyring that
encrypts and decrypts secrets when using the 'encrypted' secrets provider.

Use this command if:
  - You've forgotten your keyring password
  - You want to change your encryption password
  - Your keyring has become corrupted

Warning: Resetting the keyring password makes any existing encrypted secrets
inaccessible unless you remember the previous password. You will need to set up
your secrets again after resetting.

This command only works with the 'encrypted' secrets provider.
