# Implementation Plan for Kubernetes Registry

This document outlines the detailed implementation phases and technical considerations.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Registry Implementation
- Define `MCPRegistry` CRD with comprehensive field validation
- Implement basic Registry Controller with ConfigMap source support
- Add format conversion for upstream registry compatibility
- Implement CLI commands: `thv registry list`, `thv registry sync`, `thv registry add`
- Template system evaluation per `docs/proposals/mcp-server-template-system.md`

### Phase 2: External Sources and Advanced Features
- Add URL and Git source support to Registry Controller
- Integrate existing upstream conversion logic from `pkg/registry/upstream_conversion.go`
- Add authentication support for external sources
- Implement periodic synchronization with configurable intervals
- Add REST API service for application registry access

### Phase 3: CRD-Based Operations and Job Management
- Add dedicated CRDs: `MCPRegistryImportJob`, `MCPRegistryExportJob`, `MCPRegistrySyncJob`
- Implement job controllers with retry logic and status tracking
- Add server-registry label relationships and automatic labeling
- GitOps-compatible declarative operations

### Phase 4: Production Features and Filtering
- Add registry filtering support
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Add security scanning and validation
- Performance optimization and caching

### Phase 5: Advanced Integration (Optional)
- Template system implementation (if customer demand justifies complexity)
- Multi-cluster registry synchronization
- Advanced filtering and analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Controller Design
- **Registry Controller**: Manages MCPRegistry lifecycle and synchronization
- **Job Controllers**: Handle declarative import/export/sync operations
- **API Service**: REST endpoints for application integration

### Data Flow
1. Registry Controller syncs external sources
2. Format conversion transforms upstream data to ToolHive format
3. MCPServer resources created/updated with automatic labeling
4. REST API serves processed registry data to applications
5. Job CRDs provide declarative operations for GitOps workflows

### Security Considerations
- RBAC integration for CLI and API access
- Secret management for external source authentication
- Content validation and signature verification
- Network policies for registry sync operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- CRD validation and defaulting logic
- Format conversion accuracy and round-trip testing
- Registry filtering logic
- REST API endpoint validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end registry synchronization workflows
- External source authentication and error handling
- Controller reconciliation and status updates
- Label-based filtering and querying

### E2E Tests
- Complete registry-to-deployment workflows
- Multi-registry scenarios with label-based organization
- CLI integration and user workflows
- REST API integration with sample applications

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing MCPServer resources remain unchanged
- CLI registry commands continue to work with file-based registries
- Gradual migration path from file-based to Kubernetes-native registries

### Migration Tools
```bash
# Convert existing registry files to Kubernetes resources
thv registry migrate registry.json --output k8s-registry.yaml

# Bulk import existing servers with registry association
thv registry import --file registry.json --registry local-servers

# Export Kubernetes registry back to file format
thv registry export upstream-community --format toolhive --output exported.json
```

### Hybrid Operation
- Support for both file-based and Kubernetes registries
- Automatic detection and prioritization
- Cross-format compatibility and conversion

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of MCPRegistry resources created and actively synced
- Number of unique upstream registries integrated
- Number of MCPServer resources created with registry annotations

### Performance Metrics
- Registry synchronization time and success rate (target: <30s sync time, >99% success rate)
- Resource consumption of registry controllers (target: <100MB memory, <0.1 CPU cores)
- Time from registry update to server availability

### Usability Metrics
- Reduction in manual server configuration complexity
- Time to discover and deploy servers from external registries
- CLI command usage patterns for registry operations

### Ecosystem Integration
- Coverage of upstream MCP servers through registry synchronization
- Successful format conversion rate between upstream and ToolHive formats
- Community adoption of Kubernetes-native registry workflows
