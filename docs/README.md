[DESIGN doc](../cmd/thv-operator/DESIGN.md).

## Getting started

ToolHive is developed in Go. To get started with development, you need to
install Go and set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: ToolHive requires Go 1.24. You can download and install Go from the
  [official Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

- **Task** (Recommended): Install the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) tool to run
  automated development tasks. You can install it using Homebrew on macOS:

  ```bash
  brew install go-task
  ```

### Building ToolHive

To build the ToolHive CLI (`thv`), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the ToolHive repository to your local machine
   using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive.git
   cd toolhive
   ```

2. **Build the project**: Use the `task` command to build the binary:

   ```bash
   task build
   ```

3. **Run ToolHive**: The build task creates the `thv` binary in the `./bin/`
   directory. You can run it directly from there:

   ```bash
   ./bin/thv
   ```

4. Optionally, install the `thv` binary in your `GOPATH/bin` directory:

   ```bash
   task install
   ```

### Running tests

To run the linting and unit tests for ToolHive, run:

```bash
task lint
task test
```

ToolHive also includes comprehensive end-to-end tests that can be run using:

```bash
task test-e2e
```

### Other development tasks

To see a list of all available development tasks, run:

```bash
task --list
```

## Note on EXPERIMENTAL features

From time to time, ToolHive may include features marked as EXPERIMENTAL.
These features are not yet fully stable and may be subject to change or removal
in future releases. They are provided for early testing and feedback.
