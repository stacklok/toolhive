## Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you think you have found a security vulnerability in ToolHive please DO NOT

## How to contribute

### Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage
question, please ask in
[ToolHive's discussion forum](https://discord.gg/stacklok).

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by
providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small
sample project that reproduces the problem.

### Not sure how to start contributing?

PRs to resolve existing issues are greatly appreciated, and issues labeled as
["good first issue"](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are a great place to start!

### Pull request process

  message to indicate that the contributor agrees to the Developer Certificate
  of Origin. For additional details, check out the [DCO instructions](dco.md).

  [Commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) below.

### Contributing to docs

The ToolHive user documentation website is maintained in the
[docs-website](https://github.com/stacklok/docs-website) repository. If you want
to contribute to the documentation, please open a PR in that repo.

Please review the README and
[STYLE-GUIDE](https://github.com/stacklok/docs-website/blob/main/STYLE-GUIDE.md)
in the docs-website repository for more information on how to contribute to the

### Contributing to design proposals

Design proposals for ToolHive should be placed in the `docs/proposals/` directory
and follow a specific naming convention to ensure proper organization and tracking.

#### Proposal file naming format

All proposal files must follow this naming pattern:
```
THV-{PR_NUMBER}-{descriptive-name}.md
```

Where:
- `THV-` is the required prefix
- `{PR_NUMBER}` is the pull request number (4 digits)
- `{descriptive-name}` is a descriptive name in kebab-case

#### Examples of valid proposal names:
- `THV-1234-new-feature-proposal.md`
- `THV-5678-api-improvements.md`
- `THV-9012-authentication-enhancement.md`

#### Proposal content guidelines:
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include a problem statement at the beginning
- Add examples where applicable
- Consider backward compatibility
- Include migration strategies if needed

The CI system will automatically validate that proposal files follow the correct
naming convention when they are added or modified in pull requests.

### Commit message guidelines

We follow the commit formatting recommendations found on
[Chris Beams' How to Write a Git Commit Message article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
