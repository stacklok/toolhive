                            - Each registry gets its own mount point (consistent with ConfigMap sources)
                            - Multiple registries can share the same PVC by mounting it at different paths
                            - Users control PVC organization freely via the path field

                            Examples:
                              Registry "production" using PVC "shared-data" with path "prod/registry.json":
                                PVC contains /prod/registry.json → accessed at /config/registry/production/prod/registry.json

                              Registry "development" using SAME PVC "shared-data" with path "dev/registry.json":
                                PVC contains /dev/registry.json → accessed at /config/registry/development/dev/registry.json
                                (Same PVC, different mount path)

                              Registry "staging" using DIFFERENT PVC "other-pvc" with path "registry.json":
                                PVC contains /registry.json → accessed at /config/registry/staging/registry.json
                                (Different PVC, independent mount)

                              Registry "team-a" with path "v1/servers.json":
                                PVC contains /v1/servers.json → accessed at /config/registry/team-a/v1/servers.json
                                (Subdirectories allowed in path)
