# Checking documentation claims

When a documentation claims something it is important to check it for accuracy.

When doing that, be proactive in launching agents - when the documentation
claims something works certain way, launch @agent-toolhive-expert to provide
the fact-checking for you.

When the documentation contains a diagram, such as mermaid, launch an agent
to confirm if the flow work this way or not.

When the documentation contains an example of running toolhive, check the
arguments and command line options for accuracy and check if the example
aligns with what it is supposed to achieve.
